# Neural Network using only NumPy
This is my version of a NumPy-based neural net, loosely based on [joelnet](https://github.com/joelgrus/joelnet).

Other dependencies, like `mypy` and `typed-ast` are solely for type hints and checks.

For testing and generating datasets we obviously also have `scikit-learn` and `matplotlib`.

## Objective
Make a NN that can separate the `scikit-learn` generated datasets `circles` and `moons`, using only `numpy` and `stdlib`.
